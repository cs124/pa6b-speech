        "- Joins everything into one continuous audio stream\n",

        "### Step 4: What Gets Lost\n",
        "By the end of the pipeline, you'll see:\n",
        "- All formatting is gone (no line breaks, character labels)\n",
        "- Character names get misrecognized (\"BUCKINGHAM\" might become \"Buckingham\", \"Biscayne Jam\", or spelled out letter-by-letter)\n",
