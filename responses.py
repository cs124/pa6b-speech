    Question 1: Error Classification
    
    Compare your original sampled_sentences.json to the final 
    sampled_sentences_speech.txt. Identify and describe three distinct 
    types of errors or information loss you observe. For each type, 
    provide a specific example from your results and explain what aspect 
    of the TTS or STT process likely caused it.

    Question 2: Model Bias and Training Data
    
    Based on the errors you observed, what can you infer about the 
    training data or design priorities of the speech-to-text model? 
    Consider: What types of content does it handle well vs. poorly? 
    What trade-offs might the model designers have made?

    Question 3: Formatting as Information
    
    Your original text likely had formatting elements (capitalization, 
    line breaks, punctuation, etc.) that disappeared in the final 
    transcription. Choose one formatting element that was lost and 
    explain: (a) Why current speech systems can't preserve it, and 
    (b) What would be required to preserve it in a future system.
